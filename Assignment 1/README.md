# Assignment 1A - Visualizing real-time data

- DataViz-A.html : main implementation for this assignment.

  Try it <a href="http://rawgit.com/DhananjaiH/HCIN720-Fall15/master/Assignment%201/DataViz-A.html">here</a>.

  This visualizes weather data gathered with the help of the <a href="http://openweathermap.org/">OpenWeatherMap.org</a> API. The data (for a specific region - in this case Henrietta, Rochester) is visualized on a time series graph with the help of <a href="http://www.highcharts.com/">Highcharts</a>. The second visualization is done with <a href="http://leafletjs.com/">Leaflet</a>, for visualizing weather data over a region on an interactive map. This was made a whole lot easier with the help of <a href="https://github.com/buche/leaflet-openweathermap">this</a> library for visualizing OpenWeatherMap data on Leaflet.
